        <h3>What Are We Looking for in Submissions</h3>
        <p>Our Mission is Exploration. Build prototypes that will seed deeper exploration, provide new capabilities, or even new companies (eventually…)</p>
        <p>We realize these are rapidly built prototypes! Not everything has to be perfect.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Potential for Impact to materials/chemistry:</strong> Does it have the ability to accelerate aspects of materials science & chemistry research / learning / application</li>
            <li><strong>Innovativeness:</strong> How unique is the approach, does it stand out?</li>
            <li><strong>Relevance to Materials Science & Chemistry:</strong> How relevant is the project to advancing materials science and chemistry research?</li>
            <li><strong>Novelty:</strong> What new approaches or capabilities were demonstrated in this hackathon?</li>
