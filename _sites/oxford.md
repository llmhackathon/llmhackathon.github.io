## Welcome to the Oxford Hub

Join us at the **Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory of the University of Oxford** for the Oxford hub of the 3rd Global LLM Hackathon for Materials Science & Chemistry. We provide a workspace, collaboration areas, high-speed internet, and lots of coffee, and we will have a brainstorming and teaming session to kick things off.

- **When:** 11–12 September, 09:00–18:00.
- **Where:** TMCS Seminar Room, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford.
- **What should I bring?** A laptop, charger, and your ideas.
- **Cost:** Free.

Everyone is welcome! You don't need to be a software wizard. If you can write and understand code, you'll fit right in. In particular, we strongly encourage women and people from underrepresented backgrounds to apply. You are very welcome here.
