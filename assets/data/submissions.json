        "description": "We propose an application called Titanarium, that abstractly integrates virtual communication tools with real-world social networking services. Its key feature is that multiple LLM nodes with unique character traits (for example, modeled after scientists such as Mendeleev, Curie, or Pauling), interact on equal terms with chat nodes used by humans. As a result, discussions among LLMs can proceed autonomously without requiring human participation. At the same time, humans are free to join the discussions or simply observe them without intervening. This mechanism is similar to an aquarium or a terrarium, where one can interact with the environment or just watch and enjoy. Unlike approaches such as Mixture of Experts or Multi-Agent Debate, Titanarium does not primarily aim at performance improvement or overcoming model limitations. Instead, it seeks to provide a new user experience through conversations with AIs modeled after great scientists and through dialogues among the AIs themselves.",

Our system's novelty lies in its multi-layered approach to ensure data quality: \n\n(1) It uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for accurate, context-aware extraction. (2) A multi-agent AI cascade automatically validates each data point for both local contextual errors and global physical plausibility. (3) A definitive Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interface allows an expert to fully edit, add, or delete entries, guaranteeing final accuracy. (4) Finally, the tool enriches the curated data with verifiable links to the Materials Project and OQMD, creating a high-fidelity, analysis-ready dataset in a single workflow.

Users can use both Web Search and their uploaded papers to guide the agents choice of equations, parameters and initial conditions.\nIn Phase 2 the agent autonomously generates and executes the Python script. If the code fails, the agent analyzes the error, corrects its own script, and retries the execution in a robust, self-healing loop.\nThe final output is the full script, plots and data which is presented in an interactive dashboard with time series, phase space and Frequency analysis plots.\nThis tool helps Researchers to quickly try out ODE systems from research papers or their own ideas, suggest changes to the equations, parameters and accelerate new equation discovery.",

The system employs bilinear transduction methodology where molecular pairs are used as anchors to predict properties of target molecules, leveraging SMILES representations for chemical structure encoding. Built on the Qwen 2.5-7B model with Unsloth optimization and LoRA adapters, the framework transforms molecular property prediction into a structured learning task where the model learns to predict numerical properties (such as binding affinity in the BACE dataset) by establishing relationships between reference molecules and query molecules, enabling more accurate and context-aware predictions for drug discovery and materials science applications.",

        "description": "We developed a workflow for multilingual patent information extraction in materials science, with a focus on glass compositions and their properties. Unlike recent scientific articles, patent PDFs are far more challenging\u00d1often noisy, inconsistent, and messy in formatting.\n \nOur pipeline first converts these patents into structured text, followed by entity and relation extraction to capture composition\u00d0property pairs. To rigorously evaluate performance, we created a new benchmark dataset spanning five languages, reflecting the underexplored challenge of non-English patent literature where data scarcity is significant.\n \nWe then compared multiple models using a tailored evaluation metric, revealing strengths and limitations in handling noisy multilingual inputs. This benchmark provides a foundation for advancing robust, cross-lingual scientific information extraction from patents which is a critical step toward building more inclusive and comprehensive materials databases.",

MAGE combines a fine-tuned large language model with an agentic framework to perform both forward prediction (estimating properties from composition or structure) and inverse design (generating candidate crystal structures for a desired property). When generating new structures, MAGE integrates a MEGNet model to predict formation energy, providing insight into thermodynamic stability. The tool also features a web-based GUI where users can upload files, specify target properties in natural language, and interact with generated crystal structures through Crystal Toolkit. By bridging advanced AI models with an intuitive interface and AI Agents, MAGE demonstrates how agentic workflows can accelerate property prediction, materials design, and evaluation in a seamless, user-friendly way.",

Too often, we\u00d5ve struggled in projects where each teammate brings expertise from different fields, but explaining concepts to one another takes more time than solving the actual problem. To address this, we designed a questionnaire that captures both a person\u00d5s knowledge profile (background, strengths, comfort with math, coding, or scientific domains) and their learning profile (how they best absorb information, analogies, equations, or direct explanations). From these profiles, we generate an AI agent that adapts communication to their style. Our prototype demonstrates this process with a front-facing chat interface for personalized interaction. While our goal is a \u00d2mother agent\u00d3 to connect all these agents and summarize progress across collaborators, our current build already shows how tailored AI can accelerate mutual understanding.",

Our project takes a new approach to automating XRD fitting by using a LLM to act exactly as a human would: searching for candidate structures in online databases, writing input files, visually inspecting the results, and then making appropriate changes. It also checks and make sure the results are physically meaningful, and can use some basic reasoning to avoid non-physical results or troubleshoot issues. We were pleasantly surprised to see how well this works, with GPT-5 being especially knowledgeable about crystallography and, when augmented with the right tools, able to perform at a high level. We also added preliminary support to integrate to our datalab electronic notebook, so real lab data can be fit.",

        "description": "Predicting materials properties is central to accelerating design and discovery. While machine learning methods have shown great promise, their effectiveness is often limited by data scarcity. Large language models (LLMs), by contrast, encapsulate broad human knowledge and offer a new paradigm for materials research. In this project, we explore their potential in the domain of concrete science by benchmarking across two datasets. We evaluate zero-shot and few-shot prediction, the integration of expert knowledge within prompts, and the generation of synthetic data. Our findings show that knowledge infusion and few-shot learning enhance LLM performance under limited data. However, tree-based models remain superior, and incorporating LLM-generated data as additional training data does not yet improve their performance. These findings highlight both the current limitations and the future opportunities of LLMs, which may be unlocked through more advanced models and information fusion.",
