  - title: "2025 Chenru Duan: From MIT PhD to AI Startup: Creating Better Benchmarks for AI-Driven Scientific Research"
    description: "Join us for an in-depth conversation with Chenru Duan, founder and CTO of Deep Principle, as he discusses his journey from MIT PhD to AI startup and introduces the groundbreaking Scientific Discovery Evaluation (SDE) Framework. Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on textbook-style Q&A, SDE Harness evaluates LLMs on iterative scientific discovery workflows - hypothesis generation, experimentation, observation, and refinement.
